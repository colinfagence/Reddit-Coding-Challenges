 This program meets the requirements of "It's just the first count down (tedudu do)" and "Its the final count down" within the reddit daily programmer challenge "Challenge #253 [Intermediate] Countdown (numbers game)"
 
 This program recursively finds all possible solutions for the numbers that are given to it, these numbers are contained in an array declared within the main() method. And it will produce a string containing one solution for that set of numbers. 
 The array of numbers can be any length, but with each additional number the difficulty increase exponentially.
  
 This particular cut revolves around the rules of countdown without using brackets to create a solution.
