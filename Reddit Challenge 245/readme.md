This program implements a codec for the challenge, and can operate in two ways.

- Given a key on the first line, it can decode messages on the following lines.
- Given a piece of text, it will use huffman encoding to create a key, then encode a message.
- Given a key, can encode/decode messages in single lines.

The message can come from a file, or just be given as arguments to the class itself, the main method has a number of example of use.
